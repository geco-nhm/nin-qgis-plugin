## 1.1 Background

The Norwegian Biodiversity Information Centre (Artsdatabanken) launched version 3.0 of Nature in Norway (NiN) in 2024. To support this, a plugin has been developed for QGIS to facilitate field-based mapping according to NiN 3.0.

The purpose of the plugin is to make NiN mapping more accessible and efficient ‚Äì for both professionals and users without specialized technical expertise.

## 1.2 About this guide

This guide provides a practical introduction to using the plugin. It assumes the user has basic knowledge of NiN 3.0 mapping. The guide walks through the full workflow ‚Äì from setup in QGIS, to field-based mapping, and post-processing.

The plugin supports all NiN 3.0 type systems and adapted mapping scales, but currently does not include the variable system.

# 2 Installation

The plugin can be installed via the QGIS Plugin Manager:

1.  Open QGIS
2.  Go to `Plugins` ‚Üí `Manage and Install Plugins...`
3.  Search for "Natur i Norge kartlegging"
4.  Click `Installer`

## 2.1 Alternative: Install the latest version from GitHub

Since development is ongoing, newer versions may be available on GitHub before being added to the QGIS plugin repository:

-   Go to <https://github.com/Artsdatabanken/nin-innsyn>
-   Download the `.zip` file
-   Extract it and add it manually via `Plugins` ‚Üí `Install from ZIP`

# 3 Usage

## 3.1 Features

The plugin lets you configure a custom mapping project with options to:

-   Select type system and relevant major-type groups
-   Choose preferred mapping scale
-   Define storage location for the project
-   Set coordinate reference system (CRS) for project and `.gpkg` files
-   Choose background maps

## 3.2 Getting started

1.  Open QGIS
2.  Install and activate the plugin
3.  Launch the plugin and set up a project by choosing:
    -   Type system
    -   Mapping scale
    -   Coordinate reference system
    -   Storage folder
    -   Desired background maps
4.  Click `Lag geopackage-fil og forbered prosjekt`

**This will automatically create:**

-   A QGIS project file
-   A `.gpkg` file with the required layers for mapping

**Result:**

-   All layers from the `.gpkg` file are loaded
-   Hierarchical dependencies are established (between major types and major-type groups)
-   `Topological editing` is enabled
-   `Avoid overlap` is enabled for `nin_polygons`
-   Snapping is set to 5 px (vertices and segments)
-   The `nin_polygons` layer is configured with:
    -   Random color symbology
    -   Labels based on minor type within the selected major-type group

## 3.3 Further customization

If your project requires a different setup than the default:

-   Add custom raster or vector data (e.g. aerial imagery, protected areas, elevation data) using standard QGIS tools
-   Create new layers, symbology, or adjust layout as needed

## 3.4 Export to QField

Once the project and `.gpkg` files are ready, they can be transferred to QField for use in field-based mapping:

1.  Copy the entire project folder to a mobile device/tablet/field PC
2.  Open the project in QField
3.  Begin field-based mapping

When fieldwork is complete, data can be synced back to QGIS for further processing.

## 3.5 Mapping procedure

1.  Select the `nin_polygons` layer
2.  Enable editing
3.  Add a new polygon
4.  Fill in NiN attributes in the form
5.  Choose relevant variables for the selected type
6.  If the polygon includes multiple types:
    -   Set `Andel av naturtype` to less than 100
    -   Choose `sammensatt` or `mosaikk`
7.  Optionally take a photo (if device has a camera)
8.  Click `OK` to save the polygon
